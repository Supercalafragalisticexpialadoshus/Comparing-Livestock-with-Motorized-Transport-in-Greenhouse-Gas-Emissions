Greenhouse gas emissions from burning of savanna consist of CH4 and N2O produced from the burning of vegetation biomass in the following five land cover types: savanna, woody savanna, open shrubland, closed shrubland and grassland [[pg.60]]
Greenhouse gas emissions from net forest conversion consist of CO2, produced by the oxidation of carbon in biomass stock lost due to conversion of forest land to agriculture as either cropland or grazing land.  In 2010, world total annual GHG emissions from net forest conversion were 3,738 Mt CO2 eq [[pg.67]]
Greenhouse gases emissions in cropland are those associated with CO2 emissions from the drainage of organic soils (i.e. histosols, peatlands) for crop production. Total annual emissions from cropland organic soils are estimated at 756 Mt CO2 eq [[pg.71]]
Greenhouse gases emissions in grassland are those associated with CO2 emissions from the drainage of organic soils (histosols, peatlands) for livestock production. Total annual emissions from grassland organic soils were 25 Mt CO2 eq [[pg.71-72]]  <- done

"Although some wildfires are ignited naturally by lightning, all emissions from biomass burning have been attributed as anthropogenic emissions because it is impossible to separate out which wildfires are ignited by humans.

If contributions from deforestation and forest sinks are combined, then forests represent a net source of emissions with an average of 0.8 Gt of CO 2 per year during the period 2011–2015. This is an emissions reduction of over 50% compared to the decade 2001–2010, which generated average net forest emissions of 1.7 Gt of CO 2
