According to Lee et al. (2010), the cumulative radiative forcing from global aviation to 2005 is estimated at 78 MW m-2 including cirrus clouds. This forcing is equal to 3.5 % of current anthropogenic forcing. Overall, non-CO2 climate impacts of
aviation are estimated to contribute 49% (excluding contrail cirrus) and 64% (including contrail cirrus) to the total forcing of the sector (Deuber 2013). According to Lee et al. (2010), the total effect of aviation is 1.3-1.4 times higher than the effect of CO2 alone (excluding aircraft-induced cloudiness; GWP 100). If aircraft-induced cloudiness is included, this ratio increases to 1.9-2.0, i.e. the impact of aviation on the climate is about twice as high as the impact of the CO2 emissions alone [[pg.14]]

radiative forcing (aviation equiv. of GWP) has a multiplier for CO2 of 2.7 and so we multiply 458 * 2.7 [[pg.7]]
