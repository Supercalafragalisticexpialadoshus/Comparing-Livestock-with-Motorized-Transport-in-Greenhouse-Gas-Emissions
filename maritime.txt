-chk- For the year 2012, total shipping emissions were approximately 938 million tonnes CO2 and 961 million tonnes CO2e for GHGs combining CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The International Maritime Organization, however, has recently updated its own estimate using a detailed bottom-up fleet inventory and has found that international maritime activity emitted a total of 1,120 Mt of CO2â€“more than twice the IEA estimate for 2005.

Ships are responsible for emitting approximately 1 billion tonnes of CO2 and GHGs per year, on average from 2007 to 2012 (Smith et al. 2015)[[pg.2]]  <- inserted into essay
