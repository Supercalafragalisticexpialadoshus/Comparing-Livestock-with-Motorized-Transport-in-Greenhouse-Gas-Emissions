Oil shale absolutely causes more GG emissions than conventional gas from crude oil sources by a factor of 1.2 to 1.75.  [[abstract]]
World production of oil from shale was about 5 million barrels in 2005. Comparably, global crude oil production in 2005 averaged 84.6 million barrels per day. [[introduction]]  --*-- so 10 mil barrels is 9.46% of total production
greenhouse gas emissions are projected to be about 20–50% higher than those of conventional oil (range of 30.6 to 37.1 grams C per megajoule (MJ) of fuel, compared to 25.3 for the average of gasoline and diesel). These values are comparable to oil sands (29–36) 
Brandt (2009) conservatively estimates that the resulting greenhouse gas emissions are about 50–75% higher than those of conventional oil, and that is without considering fugitive emissions. [[sec-3.1]] <- extracting only
The EROI-ref is the energy content of the refined fuel compared to the energy required to extract, process, and refine the crude product into a finished fuel that is ready for end use. Delucchi's (1991, 2003) [21,23] work suggests an EROI-ref of about 4.7 for motor gasoline refined from conventional crude oil. Brandt's (2008, 2009) [8,13] indicates an EROI of about 1.4 for liquid fuel refined from shale oil.
