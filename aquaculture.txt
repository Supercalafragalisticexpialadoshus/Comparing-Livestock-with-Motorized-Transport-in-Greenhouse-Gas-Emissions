Aquaculture
estimated production in 2009 was 55.1Mt 
Global N2O emissions from aquaculture in 2009 estimated at 93 Kt N2O-N or 0.1461Mt-N2O or 40.92Mt-CO2e
[[IPCC-AR5--box11.4]]

Davidson-2012
aquaculture releases 0.02Tg-N2O-N/yr or 0.0314Mt-N2O or 8.8Mt-CO2e [[pg.2]]

Bouwman-UNEP 2013 (downloaded N2O)
A small amount of N2O is also emitted in aquaculture  through the release of nitrogen wastes to surface waters where nitrogen is transformed and released as N2O emissions (<0.1 Tg N2O-N/yr in 2010) [[pg.28]]
emissions of N2O from aquaculture is placed at 0.05Mt-N2O-N/yr [[Tbl-3.1]]

we estimate that production of the top five major aquaculture feed crops required ~ 99,000â€“104,000 km2 of harvested cropland area in 2008
aquaculture industry currently consumes ~ 4% of feed crops
