https://www.biogeosciences.net/4/215/2007/bg-4-215-2007.pdf  Wolf et al 2017
livestock respiration estimated at 1.5Gt-C/yr (5.5Gt-CO2) [[pg2]]
1509.2 Tg-C for animal respiration [[pg.12 Tbl.4]]

https://www.biogeosciences.net/4/215/2007/bg-4-215-2007.pdf   Prairie-2006  (downloaded)
1.5Gt-C per year from direct respiration of domesticated animals

source for 3.2% or 2Gt CO2 emissions from respiration  <- can't find

Smil, Vaclav. Should We Eat Meat? : Evolution and Consequences of Modern Carnivory, John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 2013
claims that Prairie's figure of 5.5Gt-CO2 from respiration are overly high and this is because they overestimate mass of livestock animals. However the masses quoted are in line with current weight estimates. Smil claims 3Gt-CO2/yr [[pg.173]]

Alan Calverd - 'A Radical Approach to Kyoto' DOI- 10.1088/2058-7058/18/7/46 (behind a paywall)
Carbon dioxide from livestock respiration accounts for 21 percent of anthropogenic GHGs worldwide, according to an estimate by British physicist Calverd, about 8,769 million tons  --- this is the source for Goodland & Anhang

Livestocks Long Shadow
livestock respiration accounts for roughly 3000 Megatons of CO2 [[pg.96-table 3.6]]

https://terrastendo.net/2013/07/26/do-the-math-there-are-too-many-cows/
Calverd estimates 7.4 GT emissions for CO2 respiration from livestock
this also addresses animal mass differences btwn native pronghorn and domestic livestock <<nope-it's high estimt & behind paywall

I like this 3.2% estimate better for CO2 <nope
according to USEPA ruminant farmed animals produce 80 million tonnes of CH4

I can include - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjjqqaZxtjWAhUJ1mMKHXQyDYoQFggyMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Foncejolly.wordpress.com%2Fan-analysis-of-livestock-and-climate-change%2F&usg=AOvVaw2MX1q6PhIW6CwUfheoVphR
discussion saying that Calverd's estimates of respiration are not legit (back of the envelope) but also point out that they're in line with 1.5-3Gt estimate <<nope
