Agricultural Soils

points out -
"We define agricultural N2O emissions as direct and indirect N2O emissions (the latter from N leached into waterways and N deposition) from cropland and pasture, excluding manure management. Manure management is not currently simulated as emissions from this sector occur during the collection, handling, storage, and treatment of manure, practices that are not yet explicitly integrated into the model. The explicit simulation of indirect N2O emissions is currently in development for LM3-N.1 and partially implemented in this study."

Total N2O emissions of 403 Â± 74 Tg CO2e are associated with application of synthetic fertilizer and manure (to croplands for food)
91.44% of this is synth fertilizer and 8.56% is from manure applied to soils so 368.5Tg-CO2e from synth & 34.5Tg-CO2e from poop <-too low

Nitrous oxide emissions were significantly reduced by crop residue returning combined with synthetic N fertilizers compared with emissions from treatments that only received synthetic N fertilizer.  [[sec-3.1]]

When urea (CO(NH2)2) is added to soils in the presence of water and urease enzymes, it is converted into ammonium (NH4+), hydroxyl ion (OH-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-). As in the case of liming, bicarbonate evolves into CO2 and water. ((pg.20))

Greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils consist of methane and nitrous oxide produced in the following sub-sectors: 
synthetic fertilizers
manure applied to soils
manure left on pasture
crop residues
cultivation of organic soils and fertilizers. [[pg.48-top]]
