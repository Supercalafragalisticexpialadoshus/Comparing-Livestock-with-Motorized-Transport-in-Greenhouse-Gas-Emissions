959 tonne CO2e produced in producing 1km of road. The corresponding number for maintenance is 1140 GJ (84 tonne CO 2 -equivalents) and for operation 3240 GJ (120 tonne CO 2 -equivalents). We have applied an expected lifetime of 40 years for road construction and operation and 12 years for road maintenance.[[pg.17]]
